# Questify

This is a intended to be a reasonably simple application that will be used to demonstrate various AI and LLM based capabilities in the context of an Elixir/Phoenix app.

The app will be a game will be modeled roughly in the style of a [Choose Your Own Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) book, where the player is given a text prompt and asked to navigate a series of choices that will result in a non-linear story / game.


## Local Dev

Running a local dev instance:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Run the dev db with `dev/sh/runDB.sh`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4500`](http://localhost:4500) from your browser.
