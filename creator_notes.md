## Prompting an Adventure

Here are some prompts used to create a story:

Help me write an interesting Choose Your Own Adventure story. Let's start with an overall plot, two different possible positive outcomes and two different possible negative outcomes.

Ok. Given that plot and possible outcomes, we are going to create the world of this story. This is for a game which is based on various locations that the player can explore and learn more. Can you tell me 10 locations involved in this story? One of them should be the starting location and each final outcome should have a location associated as well.

These are great. Could you give a description for each in the style of a book where you are telling the reader what they are seeing?

Create now could you define a set of commands/actions that would be available at each location and which location they would take you to? (We don't need any for the Outcome locations)

These are great. The format that I need is a Description (what the person learns if they are talking or investigating, or seeing if they move)
